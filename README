OVERVIEW
=========

Amino is library of basic utilities for robotics software.  It covers
mathematical and linear algebra routines, memory management,
time-handling, and various utilities.

FEATURES
========

Extensive SE(3) Support
-----------------------
* Menagerie of Representations:
  - Rotation and Transformation Matrices
  - Ordinary Quaternions
  - Dual Quaternions
  - Quaternion-Vector
  - Axis-Angle / Rotation-Vector / Log-map
  - Euler Angles
* Derivatives and Exact Integration
* Numerically stable log and exponential

Region-based Memory Allocation
------------------------------
* Container for LIFO-ordered memory allocation
* O(1) allocation and deallocation

Linear Algebra
---------------
* Lightweight LAPACK wrapper:
  Handles work-array creation for LAPACK using memory regions
* Multiple Runge-Kutta integrators, including adaptive integrators

DEPENDENCIES
============

* BLAS / LAPACK
* Maxima (build-time dependency only)

On Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libblas3gf libblas-dev liblapack3gf liblapack-dev maxima

INSTALLATION
============
