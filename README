RAY TRACING PERFORMANCE
=======================

Ray tracing is computationally expensive.  Here are a few notes to
help performance.

Distribute
-----------
Ray tracing is embarassingly parallel, both across multiple frames and
across pixels within a frame.  The easiest way to render faster is to
throw more cores at the problem.

Parsing
-------
While POV-Ray can use multiple threads to render a frame, parsing the
input file uses only a single core.  If large meshes are used, this
can take a noticeable amount of time, and must be repeated for each
frame.  Consequently, rather than using multiple threads per frame, it
may often be better to render multiple frames in parallel so that
parsing is parallelized across the different frames.

POV-Ray Compilation
-------------------
Ray tracing is floating-point heavy.  A few compilation flags make a
small but noticable (~10%) improvement in performance.

* -march=native: optimize for the current CPU.  This may take
   advantage of FPU instructions available on newer CPUs, e.g., AVX.
* -ffast-math: optimize floating-point computation in ways that my
   violate IEEE semantics.  Note that this could flag may slightly
   change the resulting image.
* -flto: enable link-time optimization.  This optimizes across
   multiple translation units.

FAQ
===

SE(3)
-----

* Why dual quaternions?

  - Dual quaternions are more compact and easier, computationally, to
    normalize and filter than matrices.

Scene Graphs
------------

* How can I load a URDF file?

  - Use the scene graph compiler, `aarxc`, to generate code from the
    URDF file.

* How can I reload a modified scene graph file without restarting my
  program?

  - Compile the scene graph to a shared library and load the library
    with dlopen().  To reload the scene graph, recompile the scene
    graph and dlopen() the library again.

Common Errors
-------------

* I get error messages about missing .obj files or Blender being
  unable to convert a .dae to Wavefront OBJ.

  - We use Blender to convert various mesh formats to Wavefront OBJ,
    then import the OBJ file.  The Blender binaries in the Debian and
    Ubuntu repositories (as of Jessie and Trusty) are not built with
    COLLADA (.dae) support.  You can download the prebuilt binaries
    from http://www.blender.org/ which do support COLLADA.
