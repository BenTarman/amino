#+TITLE: Amino Scene Graphs

#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

Amino uses a /scene graph/ to model robots and objects in the
environment.  Graph nodes are kinematic frames.  Graph edges are
relative transforms between frames.  Geometry attached to nodes in the
scene graph represents physical objects.

Formally, a scene graph is defined as \Gamma = (Q, N, F), where:
- Q is a space of configurations
- N is a finite set of frame labels that uniquely
  identify each frame
- F is a finite set of kinematic frames (graph nodes), such that
  each frame f_\ell = (\ell,p_\ell,s_\ell,m_\ell), where,
  - \ell \in N is the unique label frame of f_\ell
  - p_\ell \in N is the label of the parent of
    frame of f_\ell, indicating graph edge connections
  - s_\ell : Q \to SE(3), maps from the
    configuration space to the workspace pose of f_\ell relative
    to its parent p_\ell, indicating graph edge values
  - m_\ell is a rigid body mesh representing geometry attached
    to f_\ell
